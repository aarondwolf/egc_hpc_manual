# High Perofmance Computing Manual for ECG Fellows and Interns
 A guide to using the HPC cluster at Yale for EGC affiliates. This repository contains all batch files, .do files, .R, .py, .m, and .tex files needed to replicate the processes laid out in the manual (which you can find in the latex folder). Happy computing!
